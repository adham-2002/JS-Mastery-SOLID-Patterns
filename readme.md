# 🛠️ Mastering SOLID Principles & Design Patterns in JavaScript 🚀

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to this repository! Here, you will learn how to write clean, scalable, and maintainable JavaScript code using **SOLID principles** and **design patterns**. This guide provides both theoretical explanations and hands-on examples for each principle and pattern.

- Define the problem
- Think about solution
- Make your analysis
- Enhance it!

## 🔥 SOLID Principles

Each **SOLID** principle will be explained with a dedicated folder containing examples:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Each principle has its own directory with real-world JavaScript examples.

## 🎭 Design Patterns

A structured explanation of key **design patterns** with practical JavaScript examples:

### **1. Creational Patterns**

- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern

### **2. Structural Patterns**

- Adapter Pattern
- Decorator Pattern

### **3. Behavioral Patterns**

- Observer Pattern
- Strategy Pattern

Each pattern is placed in its own folder with a README and example code.

## ❓ Why Use SOLID & Design Patterns?

- Improves code quality and readability
- Enhances code reusability and maintainability
- Makes applications scalable and easier to extend
